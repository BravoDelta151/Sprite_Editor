# Sprite_Editor

To run 
>python main.py

the palettes can be defined in the data folder but the filename is currently hard-coded.  The default is an NES palette from
http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Games/Hacking/Wiki/index.php/NES_Palette

Short-cuts implemented
p - toggles palette on/off
q - quits
o - prompts for image file to open (File must be in the images folder)
shift-o - lists the contents of the images folder, with numbers, and prompts to select a file

TODO:
- Add preview for animated sprites (functionality is in sprites.py)
- Implement message box prompt
- merge palette from image
